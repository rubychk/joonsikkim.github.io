    <p>I am a PhD candidate in Sociology at the University of Toronto. I am a political and economic sociologist, specializing in comparative and historical analysis. Broadly, I am interested in how the social meaning of monies shapes financial outcomes, especially in the context of state-society relations.</p>
    <p>My dissertation research focuses on national pension fund management in the US, Canada, and South Korea. Drawing on archival data from consensus-building committees and legislative hearings, it explores how business, labor, and state contested for deciding principles on fund management in the late 1990s, and how this process shaped three distinct investment patterns since then.</p>
    <p>In a similar vein, I also explore (1) how the social meaning of foreign exchange reserves constrains risky investment and (2) how the social meaning of personal savings constrains state capacity in mobilizing credit from the public.</p>
    <p>I hold an MA in Sociology from National Taiwan University and a BA in Chinese Language and Literature from Seoul National University.</p>
