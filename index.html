        <p>I am a PhD candidate in Sociology at the University of Toronto, specializing in political and economic sociology with a focus on comparative and historical analysis. Broadly, I am interested in how the social meanings of money shape financial outcomes, particularly in the context of state–society relations.</p>
        <p>My dissertation examines national pension fund management in the United States, Canada, and South Korea. Drawing on archival data from consensus-building committees and legislative hearings, it analyzes how business, labor, and the state contested the principles of fund management in the late 1990s, and how these struggles produced three distinct investment patterns that persist today.</p>
        <p>In a similar vein, I also explore (1) how the social meaning of foreign exchange reserves constrains risky investment, and (2) how the social meaning of personal savings limits the state’s capacity to mobilize public credit.</p>
